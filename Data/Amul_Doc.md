## Introduction

The Anand Milk Union Limited commonly known as Amul is an Indian dairy brand owned by the [cooperative society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative), Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), based in [Anand, Gujarat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anand,_Gujarat). GCMMF is controlled by 3.6 million milk producers.

[Tribhuvandas Kishibhai Patel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribhuvandas_Kishibhai_Patel) founded the organisation in 1946 and served as its chairman until his retirement in the 1970s. He hired [Verghese Kurien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verghese_Kurien) in 1949,initially as the general manager, where Kurien guided the technical and marketing efforts of the cooperative. Kurien briefly became the chairman of Amul following Patel's death in 1994, and is credited with the success of Amul's marketing.

Amul spurred [India's White Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_revolution_\(India\)), which made the country the world's largest producer of milk and milk products, and has since ventured into overseas markets.

## History

Amul was founded on 14 December 1946 as a response to the exploitation of small dairy farmers by traders and agents. At the time, milk prices were arbitrarily determined, giving [Polson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polson_\(brand\)) an effective monopoly in milk collection from Kaira and its subsequent supply to [Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai).

Frustrated with the trade practices (which they perceived as unfair), the farmers of Kaira, led by [Tribhuvandas Patel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribhuvandas_Kishibhai_Patel), approached [Vallabhbhai Patel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vallabhbhai_Patel), who advised them to form a cooperative. If they did so, they would be able to directly supply their milk to the Bombay Milk Scheme instead of working for Polson.Sardar Patel sent [Morarji Desai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morarji_Desai) to organise the farmers.

Following a meeting in [Chaklasi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaklasi), the farmers formed the cooperative and resolved not to provide Polson with any more milk. Milk collection was decentralised, as most producers were marginal farmers who could deliver, at most, 1–2 litres of milk per day. Cooperatives were formed for each village. By June 1948, the KDCMPUL had started pasteurising milk for the Bombay Milk Scheme. Then-Prime Minister [Lal Bahadur Shastri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lal_Bahadur_Shastri) visited [Anand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anand,_Gujarat) to inaugurate Amul's cattle feed factory. On 31 October 1964, he spoke to farmers about their cooperative. After returning to Delhi, he set in motion the creation of an organisation, the [National Dairy Development Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Dairy_Development_Board) (NDDB), to replicate the Kaira cooperative in other parts of India. Under the leadership of Tribhuvandas Patel, in 1973, Amul celebrated its 25th anniversary with Morarji Desai, [Maniben Patel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniben_Patel), and [Verghese Kurien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verghese_Kurien).

The cooperative was further developed through the efforts of Verghese Kurien and [H. M. Dalaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harichand_Megha_Dalaya). Dalaya's innovation of making [skim milk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skimmed_milk) powder from buffalo milk was a technological breakthrough that revolutionised India's organised dairy industry.

With Kurien's help, the process was expanded on a commercial scale, which led to the first modern dairy cooperative at Anand. This cooperative would go on to compete against the established players in the market.

The success of the trio (T. K. Patel, Kurien, and Dalaya) at the cooperative's dairy soon spread to Anand's neighbourhood in Gujarat. Within a short span, five unions in other districts—[Mehsana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehsana), [Banaskantha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banaskantha_district), [Baroda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadodara), [Sabarkantha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabarkantha_district), and [Surat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surat) – were set up, following the approach sometimes described as *the Anand pattern*.

In 1970, the cooperative spearheaded the "[White Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_revolution_\(India\))" of India. To combine forces and expand the market while saving on advertising and avoiding competing against each other, the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd., an apex marketing body of these district cooperatives, was set up in 1973\. The Kaira Union, which had the brand name Amul with it since 1955, transferred it to GCMMF. Technological developments at Amul have subsequently spread to other parts of India.

In 1999, it was awarded the "Best of All" [Rajiv Gandhi National Quality Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_National_Quality_Award). In 2025, Amul was ranked third most valued brand in India in the YouGov India Value Rankings 2025\.

## Promotion and advertisement

In 1966, Amul hired Sylvester daCunha, the managing director of an advertising agency, to design an ad campaign for Amul Butter. DaCunha created an operation consisting of a series of hoardings featuring topical ads related to day-to-day issues It was popular and earned a Guinness World Record for the longest-running ad campaign in the world. In the 1980s, cartoon artist Kumar Morey and scriptwriter Bharat Dabholkar were involved in sketching the Amul ads; the latter rejected the trend of using celebrities in advertisement campaigns. Dabholkar credited chairman Verghese Kurien with creating a free atmosphere that fostered the development of the ads.

Despite encountering political pressure on several occasions, daCunha's agency has made it a policy not to back down. Some of the more controversial Amul ads include one commenting on the Naxalite uprising in West Bengal, one on the Indian Airlines employees' strike, and one depicting the Amul girl wearing a Gandhi cap.

In 2013, Amul tweeted a picture featuring the [Amul Butter Girl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amul_girl), implying that "freedom of choice" died in 2013, in opposition to the [Supreme Court of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India) overruling the judgment of the [High Court of Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court) and criminalising [homosexuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality) again.

On 17 October 2016, the Amul Butter Girl celebrated 50 years since she first appeared in the topical ad, titled "Thoroughbred". The ad showed a jockey holding a slice of bread during the horse race season in 1966\. The impish Amul girl had appeared for the first time even before that, with Eustace Fernandez showing her offering bedtime prayers with a wink and a lick of lips, saying "Give us this day our daily bread: with Amul butter"

Their ad on *Aagey Badhta Hai India* had an excellent response from the audience. It spoke about how their milk is seen as a household product, with a catchy tune associated with it. It has over 39 lakh (3.9 million) views on YouTube

In February 2020, Amul posted a picture of the Amul girl treating [Joaquin Phoenix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix) with butter after his academy award win for his role in the 2019 film, [*Joker*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_\(2019_film\)).Since Phoenix is a vegan, Amul faced criticism from vegans in India and PETA for the poor knowledge of his vegan activism and life.

In July 2024, Amul featured [Maya Neelakantan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Neelakantan), a ten-year-old guitar prodigy who auditioned for [*America's Got Talent* season 19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Got_Talent_season_19) in June 2024\.

# In popular culture

The White Revolution inspired filmmaker [Shyam Benegal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shyam_Benegal) to base his 1976 film [*Manthan*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manthan) on it. The film was financed by over five lakh (half a million) rural farmers in Gujarat, who contributed ₹2 each to its budget. Upon its release, these farmers went in truckloads to watch 'their' film, making it a commercial success. *Manthan* won the [National Film Award for Best Hindi Feature Film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Film_Award_for_Best_Hindi_Feature_Film) during the [24th National Film Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24th_National_Film_Awards) in 1977\.
