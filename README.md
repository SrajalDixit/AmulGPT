# Project Overview
## Project Introduction
AmulGPT is an interactive AI chatbot that combines RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), Ollama, and Pinecone to provide intelligent, context-aware answers. Inspired by the name Amul, this project allows users to query information and receive detailed responses based on pre-loaded documents or datasets.
The chatbot uses:
- Gradio for a clean and interactive web interface.
- Ollama as the local language model engine.
- Pinecone as the vector database for fast and accurate semantic search.
- RAG pipeline to integrate document retrieval with generative AI for precise answers.
